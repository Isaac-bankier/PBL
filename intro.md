# Introduction #

Many people find themselves looking at their phone chargers or other devices that they may own and wondering what even is electricity. Well, electricity is simply the movement of electron. Electricity is all about the forces that these electrons carry, their speeds, and the properties of the material they are flowing through.

## What is the electron? ##

The electron is a very small particle that carries a negative charge. This fact alone confuses many people. Because an electron is what is providing energy surely it must have a positive charge. Well not necessarily. When scientists talk about the charge of a particle it just means what that particle is attracted towards; positively charged particles are attracted towards negatively charged particles while they repel each other.

The charge of the electron is completely seperate to the energies it carries. So how do electrons power things. Electrons normally travel through a conductor (generally a wire) before going through a load (which could be anything but, for example, a light globe) as the electrons travel through the load they interact with the atoms that make it up. Depending on what the electrons are passing through they might heat up the material (with the electrons loosing some energy), produce movement, or even create some light.

## What is magnetism? ##

> “The magnetic field is an invisible force that can attract or repel other materials at a distance caused by the movement of electrons”

This is a somewhat accurate description of magnetism and a decent introduction to what magnetism is with one of the most important points being that magnetism is caused by the movement of electrons. When an electron moves it creates a magnetic flux that rotates around the wire. To find what way a flux rotates you can use the right hand rule: put your hand along the wire with your thumb facing in the same direction as the current the direction the your fingered curl is the direction that the flux rotates.

There are two main types of magnets, electro magnets and permanent magnets but these both work in essentially the same way.
### Electromagnets: ###
An electromagnet is essentially a coil of wire with a charge run through it. As the charge runs through the coil it creates a magnetic flux and because the wire is in a circle the fluxes compound on each other to create a magnet with a polarity.

### Permanent magnets: ###
Permanent magnets work in a similar way. Although you may be thinking what is the conductor that the electrons travel across to produce a flux? Well the answer is the electrons are just moving around in their own atomic orbitals which creates its own magnetic field.

## Magnetism is a lie!!! ##
You may be wondering how magnetism and electricity relate. Well the answer is that the are the exact same thing. To understand how this could be true we need to understand some basic special relativity.

## Relativity ##

What does relativity even mean? Well relativity is to do with the observer and changing your view to different observers. Different observers will see slightly different things. For example if I'm sitting on a moving train I would observe that I was staying still with the earth moving around me while someone on the ground would see that the train is just moving along the earth. Both are equally true. An important part of relativity is that the laws of physics stay the same for all frames of reference (observers). If this was not the case the universe could not possibly exist as we know it. There would be constant contradictions in space an everything would just generally be confusing.

## Special relativity ##

Special relativity is a theory proposed by Einstein which describe the interactions of elementary particles (the smallest most fundamental particles that make up the components of atoms) special relativity is based on two axioms:

* The laws of physics are identical except to all observers 
* The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers 

Special relativity is extremely accurate and describes the quantum world extremely well but it implies some strange effects such as space and time dilation of moving objects, meaning that if an object is moving fast relative to an observer the observer will see it as smaller and the observer will experience time faster than it. This all seems extremely strange but it has survived several experiments and seems to be how the universe works.

## Magnetism ##

So how does all of this relativity stuff relate to magnets? Well say you have two copper wires a and b, next to each other. Because there are an equal amount of protons and electrons the net charge is zero.

Now say you start running a current through both wires in different directions.

Now the two wires would feel a magnetic repulsion from each other. This is because when you observe this from an electron on wire a’s perspective you will observe yourself staying still with the protons that make up wire be moving and the electrons on wire b moving at twice that speed. Why does this change anything? Well because as we know as you move faster your length appears to shrink. This results in it appearing that there are a group of electrons close together with less protons. This makes it appear like the net charge of wire b is below zero resulting in a force being applied on wire a.

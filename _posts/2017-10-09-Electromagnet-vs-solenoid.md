## Solenoids
What is a solenoid? A solenoid is a type of actuator, an electrical component that causes physical movements. A solenoid creates a simple backwards and forwards motion by pushing out a metallic rod by using and electromagnet.

## Electromagnets
What is an electromagnet? An electromagnet is a type of magnet that can be turned on or off, have its strength changed, and its polarity flipped. Electromagnets are incredibly useful for many applications, many actuators rely on them such as Solenoids and electric motors, they are the main component of a speaker, and can be used to generate power. All electromagnets have a polarity, the direction in which the north and south end of the magnet lies. The polarity depends on the direction of the current through the electromagnet.

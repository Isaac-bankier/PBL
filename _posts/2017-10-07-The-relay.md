## Electrical relays and how they work
Say you have a very very high current that you need to transfer across a wire that can be automatically turned on and off how would you do it? Well you might try use a transistor, they act like an automatic switch allowing you to turn something on or off without needing to press a button. But transistors are designed for small, low voltage microchips, not the theoretical thousands of amps we are dealing with.

Well the best solution is a relay. A relay is essentially a magnetically activated switch. It has two overlapping thick pieces of metal that are pulled together by an electromagnet. When power is cut to the magnet the circuit breaks.

Relays are used in virtually everything high amperage for example cars which have large amounts of relays of relays used in them.

## How would you make an electromagnet stronger? 
There are many approaches to making an electromagnet stronger but there are three very effective methods outlined below:

1. More current.
Simply the more electrons you let through at once, the stronger the magnetic effect will be there will be a massive difference between even a very small electromagnet running at one amp versus one running at ten amps. Remembering that the magnetic force is just a by product of the electrons length contraction when they move, the more electrons you have moving, the greater the electric charge felt will be.

2. More coils
An electromagnet is essentially just a coil of wires, sometimes with a metal core (which can also increase the strength of an electromagnet). The more wraps you have around the coil the stronger the magnet will become significantly stronger. This will significantly increase the amount of electrons moving past a given point at once also increasing the influence they have on it.

3. Thicker, more conductive wires
When a wire is thicker it allows electrons too flow through it easier and at a higher current. This is great for increasing the strength of your magnet because you have more electrons passing at higher speeds meaning that the electrons will suffer more from the length contraction meaning that there will be more of a charge felt resulting in a higher magnetic force.
